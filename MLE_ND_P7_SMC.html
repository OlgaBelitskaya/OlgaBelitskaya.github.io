    <h3>Question 1 - Classification vs. Regression</h3>
<i>The goal for this project is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate.<br/>
Which type of supervised learning problem is this, classification or regression? Why?</i>
    <h3>Answer 1</h3>
For simplicity, the border between regression and classification can be described in this way.<br/>
- <b>Classification</b>: predict the values of discrete or categorical targets.<br/>
- <b>Regression</b>: predict the values of continuous targets.<br/>
This supervised learning problem is in the classification field. We should predict the labels for the students (<i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>) for the feature <i>passed</i>.
    <h2>Exploring the Data</h2>
We will start from loading the student data.<br/>
Note that the last column from this dataset <i>passed</i> will be our target label (whether the student graduated or didn't graduate).<br/>
All other columns are features about each student.<br/>
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
path='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlgaBelitskaya/'+\
     'machine_learning_engineer_nd009/master/'+\
     'Machine_Learning_Engineer_ND_P7/'
data=pandas.read_csv(path+'student-data.csv')
print('Data were read successfully!'); data.describe().T
</script></div><br/>
Let's begin by investigating the dataset to determine how many students we have information on, and learn about the graduation rate among these students. <br/>
We will need to compute the following:<br/>
- The total number of students, <i>n_students</i>.<br/>
- The total number of features for each student, <i>n_features</i>.<br/>
- The number of those students who passed, <i>n_passed</i>.<br/>
- The number of those students who failed, <i>n_failed</i>.<br/>
- The graduation rate of the class, <i>grad_rate</i>, in percent (%).
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
n_students,n_features=len(data),len(list(data.T.index))
n_passed=len(data[data['passed']=='yes']); n_failed=len(data[data['passed']=='no'])
grad_rate=n_passed*100.0/n_students
print ("Total number of students: {}".format(n_students))
print ("Number of features: {}".format(n_features))
print ("Number of students who passed: {}".format(n_passed))
print ("Number of students who failed: {}".format(n_failed))
print ("Graduation rate of the class: {:.2f}%".format(float(grad_rate)))
</script></div>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Preparing the Data</h2>
In this section, we will prepare the data for modeling, training and testing.
    <h3>Identify feature and target columns</h3>
It is often the case that the data you obtain contains non-numeric features. 
This can be a problem because most machine learning algorithms expect numeric data to perform computations with.
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
feature_cols=list(data.columns[:-1]); target_col=data.columns[-1] 
print ("Feature columns:")
for i in range(4): print(feature_cols[i*8:(i+1)*8])
print ("\nTarget column: {}".format(target_col))
X_all,y_all=data[feature_cols],data[target_col]
print ("Feature values:"); X_all.head().T
</script></div>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Preprocess Feature Columns</h3>
As we can see, there are several non-numeric columns that need to be converted! <br/>
Many of them are simply <b>yes/no</b>, e.g. <i>internet</i>. These can be reasonably converted into <b>1/0</b> (binary) values.<br/>
Other columns, like <i>Mjob</i> and <i>Fjob</i>, have more than two values, and are known as categorical variables.<br/>
The recommended way to handle such a column is to create as many columns as possible values (e.g. <i>Fjob_teacher, Fjob_other, Fjob_services</i>, etc.),<br/> and assign a 1 to one of them and 0 to all others.<br/>
These generated columns are sometimes called dummy variables, and we will use the <i>pandas.get_dummies()</i> function to perform this transformation.
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
def preprocess_features(X):
    output=pandas.DataFrame(index=X.index)
    for col,col_data in X.iteritems():
        if col_data.dtype==object: 
            col_data=col_data.replace(['yes','no'],[1,0])
        if col_data.dtype==object:
            col_data=pandas.get_dummies(col_data,prefix=col)  
        output=output.join(col_data)    
    return output
X_all=preprocess_features(X_all)
print ("Processed feature columns (%d total features):"%len(X_all.columns))
for i in range(6): print(list(X_all.columns)[i*8:(i+1)*8])
</script></div>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Training and Testing Data Split</h3>
So far, we have converted all categorical features into numeric values.<br/>
Next, we will randomly shuffle and split the data <i>(X_all, y_all)</i> into training and testing subsets by the following steps:<br/>
- Use 300 training points (approximately 75%) and 95 testing points (approximately 25%).<br/>
- Set the <i>random_state</i> parameter for the function(s) we use, if provided.<br/>
- Store the results in <i>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test</i>.
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
num_train=300; num_test=X_all.shape[0]-num_train
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X_all,y_all,test_size=1.0*num_test/len(X_all),random_state=1)
print ("Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0]))
print ("Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0]))
</script></div>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Training and Evaluating Models</h2>
In this section, you will choose 3 <b>supervised learning</b> models that are appropriate for this problem and available in <i>scikit-learn</i>.<br/>
You will first discuss the reasoning behind choosing these three models by considering what you know about the data and each model's strengths and weaknesses. <br/>
You will then fit the model to varying sizes of training data (100 data points, 200 data points, and 300 data points) and measure the F1 score. <br/>
You will need to produce three tables (one for each model) that shows: <br/>
- training set size, training time, prediction time, F1 score on the training set, and F1 score on the testing set.<br/>
The following <b>supervised learning</b> models are currently available in <i>scikit-learn</i> that you may choose from:<br/>
<i>- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)<br/>
- Decision Trees<br/>
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)<br/>
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)<br/>
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC)<br/>
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br/>
- Logistic Regression</i>
    <h3>Question 2 - Model Application</h3>
<i>List three supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem. For each model chosen:<br/>
- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. (You may need to do a small bit of research for this — give references!)<br/>
- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?<br/>
- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?<br/>
- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?</i>
    <h3>Answer 2</h3>
Let's make quick checking F1 scores of the mentioned models:
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
clf=[linear_model.LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear',multi_class='ovr'),
     linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV(solver='liblinear',multi_class='ovr'),
     linear_model.SGDClassifier(max_iter=1000,tol=0.00001),
     svm.LinearSVC(),svm.SVC(gamma='scale',C=1.0,kernel='poly'),svm.NuSVC(gamma='scale',kernel='poly'),
     KNeighborsClassifier(),RadiusNeighborsClassifier(radius=10),DecisionTreeClassifier(),ExtraTreeClassifier(),
     BaggingClassifier(),RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),AdaBoostClassifier(),GradientBoostingClassifier()]
print('F1 scores:')
for c in clf:
    c.fit(X_train,y_train); y_test_pred=c.predict(X_test)
    print(c.__class__.__name__+' - '+str(f1_score(y_test,y_test_pred,pos_label='yes')))
</script></div>
    <p></p>
I have chosen the following models: <i>LogisticRegressionCV, svm.SVC, RadiusNeighborsClassifier</i>.<br/>
In the experiments, they usually have a higher result than others.<br/>
Let's have a look at their applications and characteristics:<br/>
1) <i>LogisticRegressionCV</i>.<br/>
<b>Applications</b>: <br/>
- spam detection (to separate spam emails);<br/>
- credit card fraud (to detect fraud transactions);<br/>
- health diagnostics (to be sure about the right conclusions);<br/>
- banking (to predict finance defaults);<br/>
etc.<br/>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/logistic-regression-r-public-health">&#x1F578;Logistic Regression in R for Public Health</a><br/>    
<b>Strengths</b>: <br/>
This model combines strong sides of logistic regression and cross-validation and fits data for a range of parameters instead of a single parameter value. <br/>
Estimation is done through maximum likelihood and suits very well for a binary classification case (the simple "yes/no" choice).<br/>
It’s easy interpretable and regularizable and can be used as a base for checking how more complex models work. <br/>
<b>Weaknesses</b>: <br/>
It requires independent (not correlated to each other) features and quite large sample sizes.<br/>
The algorithm does not work well when variables are not enough strongly correlated with a prediction target. <br/>
This model doesn't solve non-linear problems. <br/>
Adding more and more variables to the model can result in overfitting. <br/>
2) <i>svm.SVC</i>.<br/>
<b>Applications</b>: <br/>
- face detection;<br/>
- intrusion detection;<br/> 
- complex classification of emails, news articles and web pages;<br/> 
- classification of genes;<br/>
- handwriting recognition;<br/>
etc.<br/>

<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/widm.1125">&#x1F578;Support vector machines in engineering: an overview</a><br/>
<b>Strengths</b>: <br/>
It usually offers high accuracy and fast prediction compared to other simple classifiers.<br/> 
This model uses less memory by subsetting of training points.<br/> 
It works enough well with high dimensional space.<br/>
<b>Weaknesses</b>: <br/>
It has high training time and not suitable for big data.<br/> 
This model sensitive for kernel choice.<br/> 
It doesn't work with overlapping classes.<br/>     
3) <i>RadiusNeighborsClassifier</i>.<br/>
<b>Applications</b>: <br/>
- recommender systems for clients;<br/>
- identification (persons, products or other objects).<br/> 
Examples of Real World Bioinformatics Applying<br/>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8371270">&#x1F578;Protein secondary structure prediction using nearest-neighbor methods</a><br/>
<b>Strengths</b>: <br/>
It's one of the best choice for not uniformly sampled data. <br/>
This method is universal in the meaning of applying in supervised and unsupervised learning. <br/>   
<b>Weaknesses</b>: <br/>
The algorithm becomes less effective for high-dimensional parameter spaces. <br/>
It simply collects the data examples and does not construct any internal functions, regularities or models for generalization.
    <p></p>      
All these classifiers will make enough good predictions in this case. <br/>
We should produce the result with the variant of ranking and it's a well-known fact that classification tends to be a better paradigm for ranking than regression.
    <h3>Setup</h3>
Let's initialize three helper functions which we can use for training and testing the three supervised learning models we've chosen above.<br/>
The functions are as follows:<br/>
<i>train_classifier</i> - takes as input a classifier and training data and fits the classifier to the data;<br/>
<i>predict_labels</i> - takes as input a fit classifier, features, and a target labeling and makes predictions using the F1 score; <br/>
<i>train_predict</i> - takes as input a classifier, and the training and testing data, and performs <i>train_classifier</i> and <i>predict_labels</i>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- This function will report the F1 score for both the training and testing data separately.
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
def train_classifier(clf,t_fit,X_train,y_train):
    start=time.time(); clf.fit(X_train,y_train); end=time.time(); t_fit.append(end-start)
    print ("Trained model in {:.4f} seconds".format(end-start)) 
def predict_labels(clf,t_pred,features,target):
    start=time.time(); y_pred=clf.predict(features); end=time.time(); t_pred.append(end-start)
    print ("Made predictions in {:.4f} seconds.".format(end-start))    
    return f1_score(target.values,y_pred,pos_label='yes')
def train_predict(clf,t_fit,t_pred,f1_scores,X_train,y_train,X_test,y_test):
    print ("Training a {} using a training set size of {}. . .".\
           format(clf.__class__.__name__,len(X_train)))
    train_classifier(clf,t_fit,X_train,y_train)
    f1_train=predict_labels(clf,t_pred,X_train,y_train); f1_scores.append(f1_train)
    f1_test=predict_labels(clf,t_pred,X_test,y_test); f1_scores.append(f1_test)    
    print ("F1 score for training set: {:.4f}.".format(f1_train))
    print ("F1 score for test set: {:.4f}.".format(f1_test))
</script></div>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Model Performance Metrics</h3>
With the predefined functions above, we will now import the three supervised learning models of our choice and run the <i>train_predict</i> function for each one.<br/>
We will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300.<br/>
Hence, we should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes.<br/>
It's time to implement the following steps:<br/>
- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.<br/>
- Initialize the three models and store them in <i>clf_A, clf_B</i>, and <i>clf_C</i>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use the <i>random_state</i> parameter for each model we use, if provided.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Note: Use the default settings for each model — we will tune one specific model in the next section.<br/>
- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from <i>X_train</i> and <i>y_train</i>.<br/>
- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).

    <h2>Choosing the Best Model</h2>
In this final section, we will choose from the three supervised learning models the best model to use on the student data.<br/>
We will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (<i>X_train</i> and <i>y_train</i>)<br/> 
by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F1 score.
    <h3>Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model</h3>
<i>Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model.<br/>
Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?</i>
    <h3>Answer 3</h3>
I have chosen the svm.SVC algorithm as it showed the highest f-scores for the testing set and escaped overfitting.<br/> 
The algorithm is proved to be not so time-consuming in the training and predicting processes, the number of data points is quite small and we have the result very quickly.
    <h3>Question 4 - Model in Layman's Terms</h3>
<i>In one to two paragraphs, explain to the board of directors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work.<br/>
Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction.<br/>
Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.</i>
    <h3>Answer 4</h3>
The mechanism of SVM groups of algorithms can be explained very simply using geometric interpretation.<br/>
They create decision planes (or hyperplanes) which separate sets of objects having different class memberships.<br/>
A gap (margin) between the closest points in different classes is calculated like a distance and allows to check the effectiveness of the separation process.<br/><br/>
SVM algorithms construct borders between classes using the kernel tricks which transform input data into high dimensional space,<br/>
i.e. data becomes separatable by adding more dimensions.<br/>
The choice of a suitable kernel allows to build a very accurate classifier. 
    <h3>Model Tuning</h3>
Finaly, we will tune the chosen model and use grid search (<i>GridSearchCV</i>) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values.<br/> 
We will need to use the entire training set for this.<br/>
Our steps in the tuning:<br/>
- Import <i>sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV</i> and <i>sklearn.metrics.make_scorer</i>.<br/>
- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Example: <i>parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}</i>.<br/>
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in <i>clf</i>.<br/>
- Create the F1 scoring function using make_scorer and store it in <i>f1_scorer</i>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Set the <i>pos_label</i> parameter to the correct value!<br/>
- Perform grid search on the classifier <i>clf</i> using <i>f1_scorer</i> as the scoring method, and store it in <i>grid_obj</i>.<br/>
- Fit the grid search object to the training data (<i>X_train, y_train</i>), and store it in <i>grid_obj</i>.    
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
t_pred=[]; parameters={'C':[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],'degree':[2,3,4],'gamma':[.001,.002,.003]}
clf=svm.SVC(kernel='poly'); f1_scorer=make_scorer(f1_score,pos_label='yes')
grid_obj=GridSearchCV(estimator=clf,param_grid=parameters,scoring=f1_scorer)
grid_fit=grid_obj.fit(X_train,y_train); best_clf=grid_fit.best_estimator_
print ("Tuned model has a training F1 score of {:.4f}.".format(predict_labels(best_clf,t_pred,X_train,y_train)))
print ("Tuned model has a testing F1 score of {:.4f}.".format(predict_labels(best_clf,t_pred,X_test,y_test)))
print ("Tuned model has the parameters: \n"); best_clf.get_params()
</script></div>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Question 5 - Final F1 Score</h3>
<i>What is the final model's F1 score for training and testing? How does that score compare to the untuned model?</i>
    <h3>Answer 5</h3>
The final model's F-score was improved significantly for the test data.
<div class="linked"><script type="text/x-sage">
table([['Model','F1 Score (train)','F1 Score (test)'],['Untuned',f1_scores[10],f1_scores[11]],
       ['Tuned',predict_labels(best_clf,t_pred,X_train,y_train),predict_labels(best_clf,t_pred,X_test,y_test)]])
</script></div>
    <p></p>
It means we escape the overfitting problem. This result confirms the effectiveness of the algorithm GridSearchCV for tuning.
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
In this project, some classifiers and their application to predict categorical variables were discussed in detail.<br/> 
We studied the methods of data preparing and model optimizing as well.<br/> 
The final model has an enough high result for such a small data set.
