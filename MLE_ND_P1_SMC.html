    <h1>&#x1F4D1; &nbsp;P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>Dataset</h3>
In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.<br/>A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value.<br/>This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.<br/>
<i>Origin</i>: This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.<br/>
<i>Creators</i>: Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L.<br/>
<i>Data Set Information</i>: Concerns housing values in suburbs of Boston.<br/>
<i>Attribute Information</i>:<br/>
CRIM: per capita crime rate by town<br/>
ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.<br/>
INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town<br/>
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)<br/>
NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)<br/>
RM: average number of rooms per dwelling<br/>
AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940<br/>
DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres<br/>
RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways<br/>
TAX: full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 USD<br/>
PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town<br/>
B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town<br/>
LSTAT: % lower status of the population<br/>
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in 1000 USD<br/>
The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represents aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs.<br/>
For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:<br/>
16 data points have an 'MEDV' value of 50.0. These data points likely contain missing or censored values and have been removed.<br/>
1 data point has an 'RM' value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an outlier and has been removed.<br/>
The features 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MEDV' are essential. The remaining non-relevant features have been excluded.<br/>
The feature 'MEDV' has been multiplicatively scaled to account for 35 years of market inflation.
